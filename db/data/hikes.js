    description: 'The Laugavegur in Iceland is one of the most famous and stunning trekking routes in the country. You can easily get to the trailhead and end by local bus, making it an easy-to-reach hike for many. Therefore you will notice that it’s rather busy on the hike. The distance of the Laugavegur is 54 kilometres, which can be covered in four days. Many also choose to trek onwards to Fimmvörðuháls to Skogar, meaning another one to two days of hiking. However, this section of the hike especially requires good weather. Highlights of the Laugavegur are the coloured mountains in Landmannalaugar, the glaciers you will see around you and the green valleys around Þórsmörk, where you’ll end the walk. Note that you cannot buy food along the way, and that you need to carry everything yourself. There are various river crossings, sometimes hip deep, and therefore bringing wading shoes is recommended. Although the altitude is not incredibly high, you are still in alpine environment. Generally the trail is open from end of June until the end of August and despite the fact you’re in Iceland in summer, you need to carry four-season gear without a doubt.',
